### Summary and Takeaways
- CSS research should contrast itself against surveillance capitalism research more explicitly
- 

**Primary Concern:**
- CSS "constitutes a scientific paradigm which provides tools and scientific legitimacy to a mode of capitalist accumulation"
- concern accentuated by fact that CSS located at intersection between academia and industry

- This paper attempts to "salvage the potential of methods  and  metaphors  developed  within  CSS,  by re-embedding the methodological approach of data-driven science within a **different epistemological framing** that enables social scientists to draw valuable insights from Big Data that are situated and reflexive (Kitchin, 2014:9).

**Solution: Heterodox CSS (HCSS)**
- "The purpose of HCSS, then, is not to identify laws or provide optimal solutions but to develop conjunctural explanations, offer different ways of perceiving and addressing issues, and to propose qualitatively different ways of organizing social life.


### Introduction to CSS

**Mainstream CSS Overview**
- Gradually over the last decade, consensus characterization of CSS comprised of following elements:
    - digital data
    - computational methods
    - "computational paradigm of society", Cioffi-Revilla, 2017 
    - Bauman, 2013: 56 --> focus on the "interactional structure of digital data", which emphasizes interaction, networks, and flows

- CSS views advent of digital data as an opportunity to "bring the study of social life the rigor...of natural sciences"


**CSS as an emerging paradigm towards the "physics of society"**

- cites early signs of field crystalizing
  - IC2S2 conference, JCSS Journal, and Cioffi-Revilla textbook

- authors describe anxiety of traditional social sciences being supplanted by enthusiastic CSS
  - "For these scholars, the promise of CSS is, thus, not only to contributenew methods to traditional social science research, butrather also to supplant it with‘an entirely new scientificapproach for social analysis’(Conte et al., 2012: 327)aiming to‘uncover the laws of the society"
  - "supplanting surveys and interviews with data mining and simulation"
  - 

- book about econ/physics, faster than light?

- "solution-oriented" social science answers the frustration of mainstream CSS practitioners at the "dismal state of social sciences", insofar as it does not readily provide practical tools for corporate/public policy decision making 

- history of fields with similar aims? authors criticize ahistorical, hubristic view of Pentland (2015)

**Society as a complex system, a history**

"The conceptualization of society as a complex system is expressive of an underlying‘naturalism’ in CSS: the belief that there is a continuity between the natural and social world that makes it unnecessary to appeal to qualities such as conscience, intentionality or meaning to account for social behavior"

social physics:
- Auguste Compte's Le Producteur and other 19th century scholars sought same aims

"The naturalism of con-temporary CSS is, however, of a different variety than that which  informed  19th-century  social  physics.  As Cioffi-Revilla (2017: 7) argues, CSS’ naturalism draws oncomplexity science, with its historical roots in dynamical system theory and early scientific computing at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1970s, and linked to earlier traditions of cybernetics (Galison, 1997). This ontological stance subscribes to naturalism but brings a fundamental criticism against the linearity and equilibria of traditional quantitative approaches (Cilliers, 2002

reference to papers on complex system theory"
- ...


"Such an approach allows powerful insight into phenomena in which the reflexivity and meaning-making of individuals can be bracketed, and captures well situations where these play limited roles, such as traffic congestions or pedestrian flows (Anderssonet al., 2014)"

mainstream CSS view of digital data vs. census data:
"Although census data are seen as produced for scientific analysis, digital data are a‘naturally occurring by-product’(Edwards et al., 2013) of social processes, rather than something produced for scientific consumption.  The  data  culled  from  platforms  such  as Facebook,  Twitter,  and  Instagram  are  described  as ‘imprints’or‘traces’of people’s actual behavior or moods (Lazer et al., 2020), informing us of what people actually do, instead of merely what they say they do (Pentland,2015)."

**Patterns and mechanisms**

"CSS has elaborated three main approaches to studying thesocial world: pattern-identification, simulation, and experimentation"

pattern-identification
- quantitative characterization of large data used as evidence for making qualitative assertions about underlying social dynamics
- West, 2017

simulation
- seems to draw from game theory
- barbasi albert model

large scale online experiments
- 
- Huang N, Chen P, Hong Y, et al. (2018) Digital nudging for on linesocial sharing: Evidence from a randomizedfield experiment.In: Proceedings of the 51st Hawaii international conferenceon system sciences, 2018.
- "For instance, de Rijt et al. (2014) show through an onlineexperiment that posts with many likes receive more likes,resulting in power-law distribution"


### Digital Capitalism literature

**Digital/Surveillance Capitalism**

- Mainstream CSS tends to view data as "accidental byproducts" of social life

- Literature on Digital/Surveillance capitalism views data as a commodity or form of capital/asset

- digital platforms "deployed to monetize social interactions by quantifying social life to  allow  prediction  and  manipulation"

- "The data are, in other words, not an accidental trace of social interaction–au contraire, **it would be more apt to say that the sociality is the afterthought of the extraction of digital data.**"


### CSS and Digital Capitalism

reslly does not like Pentland

### Heterodox CSS

- one primary impulse here is to critique the relationship between methodology and epistemology 

- "focus less on data anlytics, and more on the procurement, processng, and mobilization of data...", Marres and Gerlitz 2016

**critical realism literature; features**
- critical
- methdological pluralist
- interpretative 
    - Watts and mainstream CSS do not like this appraoch
- explanative
- 

**social network example**
